        "On a scale of 0 to 100, how introverted/extraverted are you (where 0 is the most introverted, and 100 is the most extraverted)? Have you ever taken a personality test like MBTI – or even better, the Big Five Personality Traits test? If you haven’t, these are tests that ask you a list of questions, then score you on a number of axes, introversion/extraversion being one of them.\n",

        "\n",
        "How well do you feel you know a person knowing only this one piece of information about them? Not much. People are complex. So let’s add another dimension – the score of one other trait from the test.\n",

        "![](http://jalammar.github.io/images/word2vec/two-traits-vector.png)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "I’ve hidden which traits we’re plotting just so you get used to not knowing what each dimension represents – but still getting a lot of value from the vector representation of a person’s personality.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can now say that this vector partially represents my personality. The usefulness of such representation comes when you want to compare two other people to me. Say I get hit by a bus and I need to be replaced by someone with a similar personality. In the following figure, which of the two people is more similar to me?\n",

        "Yet again, two dimensions aren’t enough to capture enough information about how different people are. Decades of psychology research have led to five major traits (and plenty of sub-traits). So let’s use all five dimensions in our comparison:\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with five dimensions is that we lose the ability to draw neat little arrows in two dimensions. This is a common challenge in machine learning where we often have to think in higher-dimensional space. The good thing is, though, that cosine_similarity still works. It works with any number of dimensions:\n",
