Most widely used First order optimization algorithm is Gradient Descent.The First order derivative tells us whether the function is decreasing or increasing at a particular point. First order Derivative basically give us a line which is Tangential to a point on its Error Surface.\n",

        "A Gradient is simply a vector which is a multi-variable generalization of a derivative(dy/dx) which is the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x. The difference is that to calculate a derivative of a function which is dependent on more than one variable or multiple variables, a Gradient takes its place. And a gradient is calculated using Partial Derivatives . Also another major difference between the Gradient and a derivative is that a Gradient of a function produces a Vector Field.\n",

        "It is the most popular Optimization algorithms used in optimizing a Neural Network. Now gradient descent is majorly used to do Weights updates in a Neural Network Model , i.e update and tune the Model’s parameters in a direction so that we can minimize the Loss function. Now we all know a Neural Network trains via a famous technique called Backpropagation , in which we first propagate forward calculating the dot product of Inputs signals and their corresponding Weights and then apply a activation function to those sum of products, which transforms the input signal to an output signal and also is important to model complex Non-linear functions and introduces Non-linearities to the Model which enables the Model to learn almost any arbitrary functional mappings.\n",

As one can notice if the Weight(W) values are too small or too large then we have large Errors , so want to update and optimize the weights such that it is neither too small nor too large , so we descent downwards opposite to the Gradients until we find a local minima.\n",
