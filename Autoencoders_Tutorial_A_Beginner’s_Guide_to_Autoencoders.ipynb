        "- Decoder: This layer decodes the encoded image back to the original dimension. The decoded image is a lossy reconstruction of the original image and it is reconstructed from the latent space representation.\n",

        "What’s the latent space again?\n",
        "\n",
        "An autoencoder is made of two components, here’s a quick reminder. The encoder brings the data from a high dimensional input to a bottleneck layer, where the number of neurons is the smallest. Then, the decoder takes this encoded input and converts it back to the original input shape — in our case an image. The latent space is the space in which the data lies in the bottleneck layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The latent space contains a compressed representation of the image, which is the only information the decoder is allowed to use to try to reconstruct the input as faithfully as possible. To perform well, the network has to learn to extract the most relevant features in the bottleneck.\n",
        "\n",
        "The layer between the encoder and decoder, ie. the code is also known as Bottleneck. This is a well-designed approach to decide which aspects of observed data are relevant information and what aspects can be discarded. It does this by balancing two criteria :\n",
