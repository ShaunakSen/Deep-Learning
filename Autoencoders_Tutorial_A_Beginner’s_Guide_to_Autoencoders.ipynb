        "Artificial Intelligence encircles a wide range of technologies and techniques that enable computer systems to solve problems like Data Compression which is used in computer vision, computer networks, computer architecture, and many other fields. Autoencoders are unsupervised neural networks that use machine learning to do this compression for us.\n",

        "### What are Autoencoders?\n",
        "\n",
        "An autoencoder neural network is an Unsupervised Machine learning algorithm that applies backpropagation, setting the target values to be equal to the inputs. Autoencoders are used to reduce the size of our inputs into a smaller representation. If anyone needs the original data, they can reconstruct it from the compressed data.\n",

        "- An autoencoder can learn non-linear transformations with a non-linear activation function and multiple layers.\n",
        "- It doesn’t have to learn dense layers. It can use convolutional layers to learn which is better for video, image and series data.\n",
        "- It is more efficient to learn several layers with an autoencoder rather than learn one huge transformation with PCA.\n",
        "- An autoencoder provides a representation of each layer as the output.\n",
        "- It can make use of pre-trained layers from another model to apply transfer learning to enhance the encoder/decoder.\n",
