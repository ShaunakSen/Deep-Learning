    "### What is Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With deep learning, we're still talking about algorithms that learn from data just like we discussed in the last post on machine learning. However, now the algorithms or models that do this learning are based loosely on the structure and function of the brain's neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network is a computing system that is comprised of a collection of connected units called neurons that are organized into what we call layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connected neural units form the so-called network. Each connection between neurons transmits a signal from one neuron to the other. The receiving neuron processes the signal and signals to downstream neurons connected to it within the network. Note that neurons are also commonly referred to as nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural networks that we use in deep learning aren't actual biological neural networks though. They simply share some characteristics with biological neural networks and for this reason, we call them artificial neural networks (ANNs).\n",

    "\n",
    "Nodes are organized into what we call layers. At the highest level, there are three types of layers in every ANN:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input layer\n",
    "- Hidden layers\n",
    "- Output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Different layers perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Data flows through the network starting at the input layer and moving through the hidden layers until the output layer is reached. This is known as a forward pass through the network. Layers positioned between the input and output layers are known as hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider the number of nodes contained in each type of layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input layer - One node for each component of the input data.\n",
    "- Hidden layers - Arbitrarily chosen number of nodes for each hidden layer.\n",
    "- Output layer - One node for each of the possible desired outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://deeplizard.com/images/neural%20network%202%203%202.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ANN has three layers total. The layer on the left is the input layer. The layer on the right is the output layer, and the layer in the middle is the hidden layer. Remember that each layer is comprised of neurons or nodes. Here, the nodes are depicted with the circles, so let’s consider how many nodes are in each layer of this network.\n",

For example, overweight or underweight could be the two output classes. Note that the output classes are also known as the prediction classes.\n",

    "- Dense (or fully connected) layers\n",
    "- Convolutional layers\n",
    "- Pooling layers\n",
    "- Recurrent layers\n",
    "- Normalization layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Different layers perform different transformations on their inputs, and some layers are better suited for some tasks than others. For example, a convolutional layer is usually used in models that are doing work with image data. Recurrent layers are used in models that are doing work with time series data, and fully connected layers, as the name suggests, fully connects each input to each output within its layer.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![](http://deeplizard.com/images/deep%20neural%20network%20with%204%20layers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the first layer, the input layer, consists of eight nodes. Each of the eight nodes in this layer represents an individual feature from a given sample in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that a single sample from our dataset consists of eight dimensions. When we choose a sample from our dataset and pass this sample to the model, each of the eight values contained in the sample will be provided to a corresponding node in the input layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that each of the eight input nodes are connected to every node in the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each connection between the first and second layers transfers the output from the previous node to the input of the receiving node (left to right). The two layers in the middle that have six nodes each are hidden layers simply because they are positioned between the input and output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layer weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Each connection between two nodes has an associated weight, which is just a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each weight represents the strength of the connection between the two nodes. When the network receives an input at a given node in the input layer, this input is passed to the next node via a connection, and the input will be multiplied by the weight assigned to that connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each node in the second layer, a weighted sum is then computed with each of the incoming connections. This sum is then passed to an activation function, which performs some type of transformation on the given sum. For example, an activation function may transform the sum to be a number between zero and one. The actual transformation will vary depending on which activation function is used.\n",

    "#### Forward pass through a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we obtain the output for a given node, the obtained output is the value that is passed as input to the nodes in the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until the output layer is reached. The number of nodes in the output layer depends on the number of possible output or prediction classes we have. In our example, we have four possible prediction classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our model was tasked with classifying four types of animals. Each node in the output layer would represent one of four possibilities. For example, we could have cat, dog, llama or lizard. The categories or classes depend on how many classes are in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given sample from the dataset, the entire process from input layer to output layer is called a forward pass through the network.\n",
